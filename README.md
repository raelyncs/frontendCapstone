# Front End Capstone
This is a simple front-end focused product demo page where you can select from various products, their styles, reviews, price and add them to your cart. This project was created by a team of three engineers, where each member of our team took ownership of one of the following widgets: product overview, questions and answers, or ratings and reviews.

## Quick Start
1. Clone this project
2. Run npm install to install all dependencies.
3. Run npm run build to build a transpile/bundle files.
4. Run npm start to run the express server in development mode.
5. Open http://localhost:3001 to view the app in the browser.

## My Work
My portion of this application was the Questions and Answers section. You can find the bulk of my work at client/src/components/Q&A. This section lists all questions and associated answers for a given product, sorted by helpfulness. The customer has various actionable choices such as rating the helpfulness of each question or answer, reporting a question or answer, submitting a new question or answer, and filtering all questions based on a search phrase.
